# Forage Simulation Completion and Details

These are the certificates and descriptions for the forage virtual internships I completed. I won't post what I did to ensure the integrity of the program, but if you email I can talk and share my work and what I learned!
Here are the descriptions for each of the programs:

## JPMorgan Chase Investment Banking Job Simulation on Forage - June 2024

 * Identified an ideal M&A target for a client based on an assessment of their
   strategic and financial criteria.
 * Constructed a DCF model to calculate the valuation of the M&A target and
   adjusted the model to account for a competitor bid and supply chain
   interruption.
 * Created a 2-pager for the client containing a company profile and summary of
   the auction process.
